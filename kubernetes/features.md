# Key Features of Kubernetes

- **Automated Rollouts and Rollbacks**: Kubernetes can automatically roll out changes to your application or its configuration while monitoring the application's health to ensure it doesn't kill all your instances at once.
- **Service Discovery and Load Balancing**: Kubernetes can expose a container using the DNS name or using their own IP address. If traffic to a container is high, Kubernetes can load balance and distribute the network traffic so that the deployment is stable.
- **Storage Orchestration**: Kubernetes allows you to automatically mount the storage system of your choice, whether from local storage, a public cloud provider, or a network storage system.
- **Self-Healing**: Kubernetes restarts containers that fail, replaces containers, kills containers that don't respond to your user-defined health check, and doesn't advertise them to clients until they are ready to serve.
- **Secret and Configuration Management**: Kubernetes lets you store and manage sensitive information, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and ssh keys. You can deploy and update secrets and application configuration without rebuilding your container images, and without exposing secrets in your stack configuration. 
- **Horizontal Scaling**: You can scale your application up and down with a simple command, with a UI, or automatically based on CPU usage.
- **Batch Execution**: In addition to services, Kubernetes can manage your batch and CI workloads, replacing containers that fail, if desired.
- **Extensibility and Pluggability**: Kubernetes is highly extensible and can be customized to fit the needs of different applications and environments through custom resources and controllers.
